# Honeycomb Design for React

A lightweight and flexible honeycomb UI design that allows you to build fully functional, advanced honeycomb design with minimal javascript and markup.
This library is built using native react javascript (for performance) and adheres to latest ECMAScript specs.
Supports IE10+, all major browsers and even mobile.

## Inspiration

This is a module that I built originally to solve many of the headaches and complexities around building flexible
and scalable honeycomb design.

This library has been used and adopted on many projects, including:

## Usage
